# My Serach Engine

This is the Search Engine Project which is part of the Information Retrieval Course.
Through this application, you can create an inverted index - posting files and dictionaries for a given corpus.

You can look at the "README.txt" to figure out all the installs needed and understanding the process.

## Enjoy your search ;)
